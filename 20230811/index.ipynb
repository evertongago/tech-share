    "In the vast landscape of modern data analysis, visualization, and scientific research, Jupyter Notebook emerges as a quintessential tool for professionals and enthusiasts alike. Originating from the IPython project in 2014, Jupyter Notebook stands for \"Julia, Python, and R\", reflecting its wide-ranging support for various programming languages. It is an open-source, web-based interactive environment that allows users to create and share documents containing live code, equations, visualizations, and narrative text.\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "The power of Jupyter Notebooks is in its interactive nature. Users can write and execute code in a step-by-step manner, immediately observing results, making it a valuable tool for data exploration and iterative development. This dynamic capability facilitates teaching, experimentations, data cleaning and transformation, statistical modeling, machine learning, and much more.\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "Beyond its immediate execution, Jupyter Notebooks have a rich display system. With support for a multitude of output formats, from standard texts and images to HTML, LaTeX, and even interactive widgets, it enables the creation of comprehensive reports and documentation.\n",
