    "It is possible to use an open-source LLM. The class OpenLLM is a platform that simplifies the utilization of open-source Large Language Models (LLMs). Through easy installation and server initiation, it enables developers to interact with LLMs like \"dolly-v2\" for text generation tasks. The integration with LangChain offers a streamlined approach to interact with the LLM server, both locally and remotely. This empowers developers to experiment, refine, and apply LLMs for creative applications. The integration with LangChain's LLMChain showcases how developers can generate tailored text responses based on prompts. In essence, OpenLLM bridges the gap between complex LLMs and practical usage, making open-source LLM utilization more accessible and versatile.\n",
